## 📂 Highlighted Projects

### Crypto Intelligence Platform

A real-time machine learning system for cryptocurrency trend prediction and analytics.
Tech stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, LSTM, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, Flask API, RAG/LLM Chatbot, Sentence-Transformers, PyTorch, AWS (optional)
Highlights:
Built a complete end-to-end ML pipeline for crypto price forecasting using LSTM deep learning models.
Developed data ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering, and time-series modeling modules with fully automated preprocessing.
Implemented technical indicators (returns, moving averages, volatility, RSI, MACD) and created sequence windows for training.
Trained and optimized an LSTM model to predict short-term crypto movements and deployed it for real-time inference.
Designed a RAG-powered chatbot using Sentence-Transformers for semantic search over project knowledge base.
Integrated the system into a modular architecture with REST API endpoints for predictions and analytics.
